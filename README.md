| Title | Purpose | Link |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Unreal Materials — **Noise** | Explain how **Blue**, **Perlin/Gradient**, **Simplex**, **Voronoi/Worley**, and **Brownian/fBm** noise are generated, what they look like, where they’re useful, and their performance trade‑offs. Includes guidance on **pre‑baked textures**, **fBm layering**, **domain warping**, and practical Unreal graph patterns. | [3dgd_noise](/Notes/3dgd_noise.md) |
| Unreal Materials — **Naming Convention** | Establish a simple 3‑field naming scheme (**Domain • Surface • Usage**) for **Master Materials** and **Material Instances**, with clear examples and a mind‑map. Includes a table of **material prefixes** (`MM_`, `MI_`, `MF_`, etc.) for consistent Content Browser filtering. | [3dgd_material_naming](/Notes/3dgd_material_naming.md) |
